# CLIP + TOME
This repository contains code for practicing the integration of **TOME** (Token Merging) into **CLIP** (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training). The main objective is to replace neural network modules related to `timm` and `swag` from the `tome.patch` file with `attn_tome` that employs corresponding modules from the CLIP source code.
